## Model Explainability in Bert-Based Turkish Sentiment Analysis Model
With the significant developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), complex models with higher performance have been developed. One of these models is the Transformer structured BERT model. It has been observed that BERT-based sentiment analysis models are more successful than sentiment analysis models built using lexicon-based (LB) and Machine learning (ML) approaches. In this study, we develop a local approach model-agnostic explainability method for the explainability of BERT-based sentiment analysis models working on a Turkish database.  Adjectives, adverbs and predicates in sentences are identified and replaced with their opposites, and the effect of these word types on the final prediction of the model is observed.
